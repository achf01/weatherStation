# WeatherStation
The WeatherStation machine is designed to display todays weather by retrieving information from a forecast API called "OpenWeather". What makes it special is that the weather is shown through a window where two rotating wheels create a picture of what the weather is going to look like by overlaping. In addition to that, a RGB LED is installed inside the machine and programmed to change color according to the time of the day, going from a deep blue for midnight to a violet blue for sunset, through different shades of light blue and yellow for the brightest hours of the day. For a more accurate forecast, at the bottom a LCD Display presents additional information, such as humidity, termperature, feels-like temperature, location and time.
